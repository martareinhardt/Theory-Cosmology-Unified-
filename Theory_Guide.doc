🪐 Overview

Theory Cosmology Unified is a structured cosmological framework that aims to unify the major epochs of the universe—from the primordial Big Bang to the ultimate cosmic asymptote—under a consistent mathematical and conceptual model.

This project combines theoretical cosmology, Friedmann dynamics, and numerical simulation to visualize and explore the evolution of the scale factor, energy densities, and cosmic transitions between radiation, matter, and dark energy domination.

🔭 Scientific Motivation

The model presented here follows an alphabetic cosmological taxonomy, organizing cosmic evolution into stages designated by Greek letters — from Alpha (the primordial origin) to Omega (the ultimate fate). Each stage introduces new physical components, equations, and symmetries extending the standard Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) formulation.

Major Phases:

Symbol	Phase	Description

Alpha	Primordial Origin	Initial singularity; homogeneous and isotropic FLRW start.
Beta	Early Expansion	Radiation and matter-dominated eras; curvature and dark energy terms emerge.
Gamma	Structural Alignment	Growth of anisotropies and early structures.
Delta	Perturbations	Jeans instability and density fluctuation growth.
Epsilon	Dark Matter	Non-baryonic matter and gravitational halo formation.
Zeta	Dark Energy	Accelerated expansion; equation of state .
Eta → Omega	Advanced & Final Eras	Entropy growth, tensor modes, unification attempts, and asymptotic end states.

Multiple Mathematical Patterns
that connect all phases of the structure, from Alpha to Omega, forming a cohesive whole. These patterns emerge from the relativistic foundation (Einstein's equations and the FLRW metric) and evolve with the complexity of the universe, reflecting observations such as the CMB, supernova redshift, and structure formation. Despite being multiple, they interlink into a unifying meta-pattern: evolution governed by the conservation of energy-momentum and isotropic expansion, which allows for the progressive emergence of complexity without violating the initial fundamentals.
Below, I list the principal mathematical patterns that traverse all phases, explaining how they manifest and connect Alpha (primordial beginning) to Omega (final destiny). Afterward, I discuss whether a single dominant pattern exists or if the theory thrives on the interplay of these patterns.
Mathematical Patterns Connecting Alpha to Omega
1. Homogeneity and Isotropy (The FLRW Pattern)
 * Description: The universe is approximately uniform on large scales, with no preferred directions. This pattern, derived from the FLRW metric, is the backbone of all equations, from Alpha to Omega.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: The initial equation \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho assumes total isotropy, with uniform density (\rho(t) \to \infty).
   * Beta to Omega: Each phase maintains this global pattern, even with local terms (such as alignment in Gamma or anisotropies in Theta). The curvature term (\left. -\frac{k c^2}{a^2} \right) and the cosmological constant (\Lambda) reinforce isotropy on large scales.
 * Observational Evidence: CMB (Planck) shows small fluctuations (\Delta T/T \sim 10^{-5}), confirming global isotropy.
 * Why it Persists? The FLRW metric ensures that any anisotropic deviation (e.g., shear) decays rapidly (\sigma \propto 1/a^3), preserving the pattern.
2. Conservation of Energy-Momentum
 * Description: The universe's evolution obeys the continuity equation (\dot{\rho} + 3H (\rho + p) = 0), derived from Einstein's equations, which ensures the conservation of total energy.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: Defines how the initial density (\rho) drives expansion.
   * Beta to Epsilon: Regulates the dilution of densities (\rho_m \propto 1/a^3, \rho_r \propto 1/a^4).
   * Zeta to Omega: Maintains consistency even with complex terms (e.g., entropy in Eta, vector fields in Theta), ensuring that new terms (such as A(t) or \Omega_\infty) do not violate conservation.
 * Observational Evidence: Consistency between measured densities (e.g., \Omega_m \approx 0.3, \Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7) and redshift.
 * Why it Persists? It is a fundamental principle of general relativity, underlying all phases.
3. Dilution by Expansion
 * Description: The expansion of the universe (a(t)) reduces energy densities and weakens local effects, such as curvature and anisotropies.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: Expansion begins, diluting \rho(t).
   * Beta: Introduces curvature (k/a^2) and dark energy (\Lambda), both modulated by a(t).
   * Gamma to Omega: Every new term (e.g., \delta \rho, \rho_\nu, A(t)) is affected by dilution, except for \Lambda, which dominates in Omega (H \to \sqrt{\Lambda/3}).
 * Observational Evidence: Galaxy redshift (Hubble-Lemaître) and matter density decay.
 * Why it Persists? It is a geometric consequence of the FLRW metric: volumes grow as a^3, diluting components.
4. Growth of Perturbations
 * Description: Small initial fluctuations (\delta \rho) grow gravitationally, forming structures, but are regulated by expansion.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: Fluctuations are "seeds" implicit in the initial density.
   * Delta: Explicitly introduces \delta \rho, with linear growth (\delta \propto a(t)).
   * Gamma, Epsilon, Theta: Alignments (e.g., A(t)) and anisotropies (e.g., h_{ij}) emerge as byproducts of perturbations.
   * Omega: Perturbations "freeze" on local scales due to acceleration.
 * Observational Evidence: CMB power spectrum; galaxy formation (SDSS, Euclid).
 * Why it Persists? The perturbation equation (\ddot{\delta} + 2H \dot{\delta} - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_m H^2 \delta = 0) is consistent across all phases.
5. Increasing Entropy
 * Description: The total entropy of the universe increases with time (2nd law of thermodynamics), especially with expansion.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha to Beta: Entropy implicit in the initial uniformity (low gravitational entropy).
   * Eta: Introduces an explicit entropy term (S(t)/a^3), growing with the horizon.
   * Omega: Maximum entropy in the final state (Big Chill, holographic entropy).
 * Observational Evidence: Increase in the cosmological horizon; black hole entropy.
 * Why it Persists? Expansion increases phase space volume, while interactions (e.g., gravitational collapse) increase local disorder.
6. Emergence of Local Anisotropies with Global Isotropy
 * Description: Alignments and anisotropies arise locally (e.g., galactic spins, tidal fields), but the universe maintains isotropy on large scales.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: Totally isotropic.
   * Gamma: Introduces alignment (\epsilon \cdot A(t)), weak enough not to break global isotropy.
   * Theta, Rho, Sigma: Local anisotropies grow (e.g., gravitational waves, rotation), but decay globally (\sigma \propto 1/a^3).
   * Omega: Alignments "freeze" locally but are globally insignificant.
 * Observational Evidence: Galaxy alignments (SDSS); CMB isotropy.
 * Why it Persists? Expansion dilutes global anisotropies, while local gravity amplifies directional patterns.
7. Symmetries and Conservations (Noether)
 * Description: Symmetries in spacetime (e.g., Lorentz invariance, gauge) lead to conservation laws that traverse all phases.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha to Beta: Translational symmetry (homogeneity) and rotational symmetry (isotropy).
   * Iota: Lorentz invariance for neutrinos.
   * Sigma: Symmetry groups (e.g., SU(2), U(1)) for interactions.
   * Upsilon: Attempts at unification (GUT).
 * Observational Evidence: Conservation of energy in supernovae; particle symmetries (LHC).
 * Why it Persists? Noether's theorem guarantees that underlying symmetries generate universal conservations.
8. Asymmetries and Anomalies
 * Description: Small symmetry breakings (e.g., baryogenesis) and observational anomalies shape the evolution.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Kappa: Matter-antimatter asymmetry (\eta_b).
   * Xi, Tau: Anomalies (e.g., Hubble tension, H_0).
   * Omega: Resolution or acceptance of discrepancies in the final limit.
 * Observational Evidence: Matter excess (CMB); tensions in H_0 measurements.
 * Why it Persists? Small breakings are amplified by expansion and gravitational dynamics.
A Single Pattern or Multiple Patterns?
Although multiple patterns exist, there is a unifying meta-pattern connecting Alpha to Omega: the dynamic evolution of the universe is governed by an interplay between conservation (of energy, momentum, symmetries) and expansion (dilution, structure growth). This meta-pattern is expressed in the Friedmann equation, which evolves from:
to:
Why not a single pattern?
 * The complexity of the universe requires multiple interacting patterns (e.g., global isotropy vs. local anisotropies, conservation vs. increasing entropy).
 * Each phase adds a pattern that reflects an aspect of evolution (e.g., baryogenesis in Kappa, cycles in Pi), but all are consistent with the FLRW metric and Einstein's equations.
The Unifying Meta-Pattern:
 * Mathematically: The Friedmann equation is the common thread, with each new term (e.g., A(t), S(t)) being a perturbation or extension that obeys conservation and expansion.
 * Conceptually: The universe begins simple (Alpha), grows in complexity (Beta to Psi), but maintains coherence until a final state (Omega), where local patterns (like alignments) coexist with global dilution.
Conclusion
There are multiple mathematical patterns (homogeneity, conservation, dilution, perturbations, entropy, anisotropies, symmetries, anomalies) that connect Alpha to Omega, unified by a meta-pattern: the dynamic evolution under the FLRW metric, where expansion regulates complexity without losing initial coherence. These patterns are testable with data (CMB, supernovae, LIGO), and the alignment (introduced in Gamma) persists as a local pattern that does not break global isotropy.
More Identified Mathematical Patterns
Based on the structure of our theory (Alpha to Omega), and inspired by cosmological concepts derived from the Friedmann equations (such as accelerated expansion, density parameters, and scaling relations), I will add new patterns that logically emerge "from them." These new patterns are not random – they arise from the interaction of the preceding ones, such as dilution leading to era transitions or conservation implying fine-tuning.
I will list 4 new mathematical patterns I have identified, explaining how they connect to the existing ones and traverse the phases (Alpha to Omega). Afterwards, I propose a unifying pattern derived from all (the 8 originals + these 4 new ones), which captures the essence of the theory as a whole. Everything is kept classical and observational, non-quantum, and anchored in the Friedmann equation.
9. Transitions of Dominance Eras (Radiation-Matter-Dark Energy)
 * Description: The universe passes through phases where different energy components dominate expansion, with smooth mathematical transitions governed by the differential dilution of densities.
 * How it Arises from Existing Patterns: Combines dilution by expansion (pattern 3) with conservation of energy-momentum (pattern 2). Densities decay at different rates (\rho_r \propto 1/a^4, \rho_m \propto 1/a^3, \rho_\Lambda \propto constant), leading to crossovers where one term dominates the other in the Friedmann equation.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha to Beta: Initial radiation dominance (high \rho), transition to matter in Beta/Delta.
   * Zeta to Omega: Dark energy (\Lambda) dominates at the end, accelerating expansion (\ddot{a} > 0).
 * Observational Evidence: Matter-dark energy transition at z \approx 0.5 (Type Ia supernova data); CMB confirms early radiation era.
 * Related Equation: From the Friedmann equation, the deceleration parameter q = -\frac{\ddot{a} a}{\dot{a}^2} = \frac{1}{2} \Omega_m - \Omega_\Lambda, which changes sign during the transitions.
10. Critical Density Parameters (Omegas and Flatness)
 * Description: The total density of the universe is parameterized as fractions of the critical density (\rho_c = \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}), with \Omega_{tot} = \Omega_m + \Omega_r + \Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_k = 1 in flat universes, reflecting a delicate balance.
 * How it Arises from Existing Patterns: Emerges from homogeneity/isotropy (pattern 1) and dilution (pattern 3), with conservation (pattern 2) ensuring that the Omegas evolve consistently. The curvature term (\Omega_k = -k c^2 / (H^2 a^2)) tends towards zero, implying flatness.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: \Omega_{tot} \approx 1 initially, with fine-tuning to avoid collapse or runaway expansion.
   * Lambda to Omega: \Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7 dominates, resolving the "flatness problem" (why is \Omega_{tot} close to 1?).
 * Observational Evidence: Planck CMB: \Omega_k \approx 0, \Omega_m \approx 0.3, \Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7.
 * Related Equation: Friedmann equation rewritten: H^2 = H_0^2 (\Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_r a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_\Lambda).
11. Power-Law Scaling Relations
 * Description: Many cosmological quantities follow power laws as a function of the scale factor a(t), such as densities, temperatures, and wavelengths, creating self-similar patterns on different scales.
 * How it Arises from Existing Patterns: Directly from the growth of perturbations (pattern 4) and dilution (pattern 3), with symmetries (pattern 7) ensuring scale invariance in linear modes. E.g., the primordial power spectrum is nearly invariant (P(k) \propto k^{n_s - 1}, n_s \approx 0.96).
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha to Delta: Perturbations grow as \delta \propto a^\alpha (\alpha=1 in the matter era).
   * Pi to Omega: Cycles or rotations (e.g., vorticity \omega \propto 1/a) follow power-laws, persisting in asymptotic limits.
 * Observational Evidence: Hubble's Law (v = H d); scaling in large-scale structure (N-body simulations).
 * Related Equation: Analytical solutions of the Friedmann equation: a(t) \propto t^{2/3} (matter era), a(t) \propto t^{1/2} (radiation era), a(t) \propto e^{H t} (dark energy era).
12. Instabilities and Initial Fine-Tuning
 * Description: The universe exhibits mathematical instabilities at the Big Bang (singularity) and requires precise initial conditions to evolve as observed, such as low initial entropy or near-perfect flatness.
 * How it Arises from Existing Patterns: Integrates increasing entropy (pattern 5) with asymmetries/anomalies (pattern 8) and the growth of perturbations (pattern 4). Expansion amplifies small instabilities, but conservation regulates them.
 * Manifestation across Phases:
   * Alpha: Unstable singularity (H \to \infty), with fine-tuning to prevent immediate collapse.
   * Delta to Omega: Instabilities like Jeans lead to structures, but fine-tuning explains why the universe did not collapse or expand too quickly (e.g., the flatness problem is solved by inflation, but here classically via \Omega_k \to 0).
 * Observational Evidence: CMB anisotropies show finely tuned initial seeds; Hubble tension as a possible anomaly.
 * Related Equation: Near the Big Bang, the Friedmann equation simplifies to \dot{a}^2 \propto \rho a^2, with instability if \rho is not exactly critical.
A Unifying Pattern Derived from All
From the 12 patterns (the 8 originals + these 4 new ones), I have identified one unifying mathematical pattern that encompasses them: the Principle of Regulating Expansion.
 * Description: The universe's expansion (a(t)) acts as a "universal regulator" that balances conservation, dilution, and growth, allowing for the emergence of complexity (from initial isotropy to local structures) without catastrophic instabilities. Mathematically, this manifests in the Friedmann equation as a dynamic equilibrium where positive terms (densities) compete with negative (curvature) and constant (\Lambda) terms, with H(t) serving as the regulation metric.
 * How it Arises from All Patterns:
   * From the Initials: Homogeneity (1) and conservation (2) provide the stable foundation; dilution (3) and perturbations (4) create the dynamics; entropy (5), anisotropies (6), symmetries (7), and anomalies (8) add layers of complexity regulated by expansion.
   * From the New: Era transitions (9) are regulated by differential dilution; Omegas (10) measure the equilibrium; power-laws (11) are a consequence of scaling with a(t); instabilities (12) are "tamed" by expansion to prevent collapse.
 * Manifestation from Alpha to Omega:
   * Alpha: Expansion initiates as the regulator of the singularity, preventing total chaos.
   * Middle (Beta to Psi): Regulates transitions, growth, and symmetries, allowing structures without breaking isotropy.
   * Omega: Expansion accelerates towards infinity, regulating the final destiny (Big Chill), where maximum entropy and total dilution converge.
 * Unifying Equation: The complete Friedmann equation in Omega captures this: all terms are modulated by a(t), with expansion braking instabilities (e.g., k/a^2 \to 0) and amplifying emergent patterns (e.g., \delta \propto a).
 * Observational Evidence: The \LambdaCDM model (based on this) fits 99% of cosmological data; expansion regulates the "why" of the observable universe being habitable (anthropic fine-tuning).
 * Implications for Our Theory: This unifying pattern explains why alignment (from Gamma) persists locally: expansion "regulates" it so that it does not dominate globally, but emerges from perturbations.
