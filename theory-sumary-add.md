# Theory Cosmology Unified - Mathematical and Conceptual Summary

This document details the theoretical and mathematical framework of the unified model, which extends the standard FLRW (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) formulation to incorporate the evolution of the cosmos through dynamic phases.

## I. The Starting Point: The FLRW Model (Alpha Phase)

The base model rests on the **FLRW metric** and the **Cosmological Principle** (homogeneity and isotropy on large scales).

The expansion dynamics are governed by the **Friedmann Equation** (first equation) and the **Acceleration Equation** (second equation), defined by the cosmic scale factor $a(t)$:

### Fundamental Equation (Friedmann):
$$\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho(t) - \frac{k c^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}$$

Where $\rho(t)$ is the total energy density, which is generally decomposed as:
$$\rho(t) = \rho_{\text{rad}} a^{-4} + \rho_{\text{mat}} a^{-3} + \rho_{\Lambda}$$

## II. Unified Cosmological Taxonomy ($\alpha \to \zeta$)

The Unified-Theory model classifies the universe's evolution into successive stages, where the Friedmann Equation is sequentially generalized (Phase Beta $\to$ Phase Zeta).

| Symbol | Phase | Dominant Added Components | Key Generalization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\alpha$ | **Primordial Origin** | $\rho_{\text{rad}}$ (Radiation) | Homogeneous and isotropic start. |
| $\beta$ | **Early Expansion** | $\rho_{\text{mat}}$ (Baryonic Matter and Curvature $k$) | Introduction of matter and the curvature term. |
| $\gamma$ | **Structural Alignment** | Perturbations (Density Growth $\delta\rho$) | Focus on density fluctuations and Jeans Instability. |
| $\epsilon$ | **Dark Matter** | $\rho_{\text{DM}}$ (Addition of non-baryonic matter) | Modeling of Cold Dark Matter (CDM). |
| $\zeta$ | **Dark Energy** | $\rho_{\Lambda}$ (Cosmological Constant) | Dominance of accelerated expansion. |

## III. Advanced Hypothesis: Dynamic Coupling (Phase $\eta$ and $\omega$)

This section integrates the hypothesis that expansion is not merely a consequence, but an **active agent** capable of modifying the fundamental patterns of the universe. This explains the remaining, unexplained portion as the **temporal evolution of physical laws** themselves.

### A. Dynamic Substitution of $\Lambda$

In Phase $\eta$ and beyond, the static cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is replaced by a **Dynamic Scalar Field ($\phi$)**, representing a model of evolving Dark Energy (e.g., Quintessence).

The energy density of this field is:
$$\rho_{\phi} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)$$

### B. The Coupling of Expansion to Subatomic Patterns

The universe's expansion (manifested by the dynamic field $\phi$) is introduced to microphysics through an **Acopling Term** ($\alpha \neq 0$) in the **Klein-Gordon Equation**, which governs the evolution of the field $\phi$:

$$\mathbf{\ddot{\phi} + 3H \dot{\phi} + \frac{dV}{d\phi} = -\frac{\alpha}{M} \left( \rho_{\text{mat}} - 3P_{\text{mat}} \right)}$$

* **$3H \dot{\phi}$:** The **Hubble friction** term represents the damping effect of expansion on the field $\phi$.
* **Coupling Term (RHS):** The coefficient $\alpha$ defines the strength of the interaction between the field $\phi$ and matter/pressure densities.

**Theoretical Implication:** If $\alpha \neq 0$, the Dark Energy field couples with matter, inducing a temporal variation in fundamental physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant or the effective gravitational constant $G_{\text{eff}}$). This means the **subatomic mathematical patterns are dynamic and dependent on the cosmic history**.

### C. Final Phases (Omega)

The final phases (Eta $\to$ Omega) explore the asymptotic solutions of the coupled system $(\dot{a}, \dot{\phi})$, determining the ultimate fate of the universe under the influence of this dynamic evolution of fundamental patterns.
