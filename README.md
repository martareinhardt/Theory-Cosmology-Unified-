# 🪐 Theory Cosmology Unified

A numerical model to test hypotheses of **cosmological unification**, simulating the variation of physical constants over time.  
This project combines *theoretical physics*, *numerical analysis*, and *scientific visualization* in Python.

## 📊 Scientific Goal

This project investigates:

Cosmological models with variable physical constants (e.g., H₀(t), G(t))

Expansion and energy density equations

Visualization of the temporal evolution of the observable universe


Partial results and visualizations are stored in the results/ folder and documented in paper/.




## 🔭 Next Steps

Implement models with dynamic dark energy

Automate testing and code quality checks using GitHub Actions

Add scientific documentation in LaTeX or PDF format

Create an interactive web visualization with Plotly or Bokeh
