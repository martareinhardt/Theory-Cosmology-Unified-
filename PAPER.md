Abstract

This paper presents Theory Cosmology Unified, a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe’s evolution from its primordial origin (Alpha) to its asymptotic future (Omega). The model integrates classical Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) cosmology with successive theoretical extensions, introducing perturbative, thermodynamic, and philosophical terms. Numerical simulations based on the Friedmann equation illustrate the evolution of the scale factor and the transitions between radiation, matter, and dark energy-dominated epochs. This structured theory aims to unify physical, mathematical, and conceptual elements into a coherent cosmological narrative.

1. Introduction

The pursuit of a unified cosmological description has guided modern physics since the inception of general relativity. The FLRW metric provides a foundational geometric structure, but cosmological evolution encompasses far more than curvature and energy density — it unfolds through successive eras, each characterized by distinct physical phenomena and symmetries.

The Theory Cosmology Unified introduces an alphabetic progression — from Alpha to Omega — that captures the unfolding of cosmic complexity. Each stage adds new mathematical components, reflecting not only the physical but also the metaphysical dimensions of cosmic evolution.

2. Methodology

2.1. Theoretical Structure

The base model derives from the Friedmann equation:

\left( \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)} \right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho(t) - \frac{k c^2}{a(t)^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}

Perturbative fluctuations 

Dark matter and energy contributions 

Entropy and anisotropy terms 

Tensor modes and vector fields 


Each phase (Alpha → Omega) incorporates these components to reflect successive layers of cosmic complexity.

2.2. Numerical Simulation

The system of equations was numerically integrated using scipy.odeint, with parameters calibrated to the Planck 2018 cosmological constants:








The simulation evaluates  across normalized cosmic time, producing outputs for the scale factor and the relative energy densities.

3. Results

The resulting plots illustrate two major aspects:

Figure 1: Scale factor evolution, , as a function of normalized time.

Figure 2: Evolution of density parameters  vs. redshift.




Transition epochs are consistent with observational data:

Radiation–Matter Transition: 

Matter–Dark Energy Transition: 


These results confirm the model’s alignment with the ΛCDM baseline while enabling theoretical generalizations beyond standard cosmology.

4. Discussion

The Theory Cosmology Unified expands traditional cosmology by layering additional dimensions of meaning:

Physical: integration of relativistic, thermodynamic, and quantum fields.

Mathematical: expansion of the Friedmann equation through higher-order and coupled terms.

Philosophical: reintroduction of the observer and consciousness as boundary conditions in late-phase cosmology (Ψ phase).


By structuring the universe’s evolution alphabetically (Alpha → Omega), the framework serves as both a scientific taxonomy and a metaphysical map.


---

5. Conclusion

The unified theory bridges numerical simulation and conceptual cosmology. It demonstrates that cosmic evolution can be viewed as a structured hierarchy of equations — each describing a successive layer of reality. Future work may extend this framework to quantum-gravity regimes or multiversal boundary conditions.
